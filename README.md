# leaflet-challenge

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, I will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

## My Task

I've created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the significant earthquakes in the past 7 days based on their longitude and latitude.

- I have included data markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

- Popups are also included that provide the name and magnitude of the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

- Lastly, there is a legend that to provide context to my maped data.
